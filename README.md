# C notes
### This repository contains very basic notes I took while learning the C language. 

### It is suitable for students who are too lazy to read the documentation and want to get a quick start with the C language.

### I have also included some examples to make the terms easier to understand. You can copy the code in the code blocks and run them in your own Ide to see how they work. I hope it helps you, even a little bit, on your journey.
